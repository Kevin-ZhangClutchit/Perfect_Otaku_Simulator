# Perfect_Otaku_Simulator
## Basic Introduction
Use clumsy algorithm and implementation to simulate Gacha

This project is required by our dear "Ji Ge".
## Progress
Python version code and exe completed.
Cpp version code and static-compiled code completed.
Chinese cpp version completed.

## Other
As I haven't systematically learned algorithm and efficiency yet, I will rewrite this project after I have a deeper understanding.
Thanks for help from chat friends, python ver has been finished roughly.
