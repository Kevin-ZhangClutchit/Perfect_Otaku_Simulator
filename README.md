# Perfect_Otaku_Simulator
## Basic Introduction
Use clumsy algorithm and implementation to simulate Gacha

This project is required by our dear "Ji Ge".
## Progress
Python version code and exe completed.
Cpp version code remaining to be updated as it seems to take too much memory.

## Other
As I haven't systematically learned algorithm and efficiency yet, I will rewrite this project after I have a deeper understanding.
Thanks for help from chat friends, python ver has been finished roughly and I will find how to write it in cpp more efficient.
